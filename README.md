The Beautiful Beginning to the rest of my life
Hello Everyone!

My name is Clintonidus! I'm 35 years young,iquisitive, and indecisive as hell.
I've had a natural passion for computers since, dial-up, and learning the home row keys, just never truely pursued the passsion.  That changes now.
I'm hoping this community helps me.
